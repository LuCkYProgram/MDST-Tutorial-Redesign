Introduce yourself in this file!

*Hello!* My name is Kevin Hong and I am a junior (graduating 2024). I am studying and majoring in Data Science in LSA.
Some facts about me is that I just transferred from MSU so going to the rival school now haha!
Another thing about me is that I get pretty serious in games so anything that has numbers, lets plug it in an excel sheet or even program something to get the best optimal outcome.
Finally, I play the alto saxophone! Hope I got some music lovers out here!
